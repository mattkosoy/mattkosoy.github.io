# My website.

Based off of [pixyll.com](http://www.pixyll.com)  a simple, beautiful theme for Jekyll that emphasizes content rather than aesthetic fluff. It's mobile _first_, fluidly responsive, and delightfully lightweight. It was originally built by [John Otander](http://johnotander.com).  

Thanks John.
