  <h2>The Introduction: a brief history of the project scenario</h2>
  <p>By early 2015 it had become painfully clear that <a href="http://www.specialized.com">specialized.com</a> had become obsolete. The experience of interacting with its interface was a little frustrating to say the least. The experience of having to do maintenance work, which was becoming 80% of our job, was also equally as frustrating.</p>

  <p>The process for deploying code had become very complicated. We always said to each other when deploying, "Don't forget Step 19.  Don't fuck it up". <blockquote>Step 19: don't fuck it up.</blockquote> The legacy version of Specialized site was built using JSP files that were included in one another procedureally. There was a huge amount of effort and work and love that went into that creating that version of the site, but the lack of documentation made the change to a new framework inevitable. The appreciation was deep for those team members who had worked long and hard hours on the original site. However everyone knew that techniques had adapted so very rapidly in recent years that the old code had to be abandoned.</p> 

  <p>On a winters' day in early February our department head called a team meeting. He posed a question to the entire team: What would your requirements be if you wanted to create a new website for specialized?. It was then that the fun began, and after an afternoon of brainstorming we ended up with these 5 core values that the site <em>had</em> to have.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Responsive UI</li>
    <li>Hosted on/in the cloud</li>
    <li>Ease of deployment for dev team</li>
    <li>Personalized content for the user</li>
    <li>Localized content for the user</li>
  </ol>
 
  <h2>Choosing the path forward</h2>

  <p>A vote was taken, and we as group chose to use a full stack Javascript environment. That was, after all, how <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/internet/entries/47a96d23-ae04-444e-808f-678e6809765d">the BBC</a> was doing it. It was good to have that point of reference during our vote. Once we knew that another enterprise was using this type of technology that we could too. By the beginning of March 2015 we had settled in on our new tech stack.</p>

  <h2>My role, specifically</h2>

  <p>My contributions at this part were crucial to the success of the project, ultimately. On my own time I did research into current best practices, and I created an app that was based on an <a href="https://github.com/petecoop/generator-express">open source project</a> I found. I also </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Automate our development processes by using a <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">build system</a>.</li>
    <li>Leverage an <a href="https://expressjs.com/">MVC style</a> architecture.</li>
    <li><a href="https://heroku.com">Host</a> our application in the cloud for scalability.</li>
    <li>Collect data from our users and store it in a <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/">CRM</a>.</li>
    <li>Do <a href="https://circleci.com/">continuous integration</a> and deployment.</li>
    <li>Sell things online.</li>
    <li>Use tools that enable clear <a href="https://slack.com">communication</a> between team members</li>
    <li>Integrate with a variety of 1st and <a href="https://contentful.com">3rd</a> <a href="https://algolia.com">party</a> <a href="https://greenhouse.io">APIs</a>.</li>
    <li>Adapt our workflow to one that is more agile, and leverages an <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/protocol/git">open source development protocol</a>.</li>
  </ul>


  <p>Fortunately for me the environment at Specialized, at the time, enabled me to implement all of these things. I worked with team members in multiple departmentsn across the company, and with vendors to help set up this new way of communicating about the website. It was on!</p>
