## Introduction 

* set the stage. 
* describe why we need a metaphor.
* common metaphors - home construction
* what's wrong w/ construction:  software is alive.
* ( use 2 images )


## Preparing the site

* for a website to be successful, just like a garden, a tremendous amount of preparation and planning are required.  
* Site evaluation. Which areas get the most sunlight?
* determine what needs to be completely demolished. because destroying old things is fun.
* select the best ~~variety of plants~~ content strategy for your needs. 
* knowledge transfer.  make sure your team members are on the same page at al steps.  community garden comparission.

## Hardscaping

* determine what parts of your garden are structure and can't be moved
* in a website context: this might mean determinig a new, more efficient,  schema for a legacy database table. 
* we're going to plant around and in this structure. we want to make the right choice for the situation.


## Turn the soil

Bad software development habits are a bit like perennial weeds. If you don't dig out as many roots as you can then the weeds will grow back. In the context of a website this means that outdated software development techniqes will persist into your brand new project unless those techniques are removed by "the roots".

Smart gardeners turn their soil over before planting a new crop. This allows new plantings to grow more easily because the soil is loose and full of oxygen. 

List of benefits for turning the soil
1. lipsum
2. dolor
3. sit
4. amet

## Things start to fill in.

* garden prep is like website prototyping.  explain why.
* just as the garden starts to fill,  in the website prototype becomes to be more vibrant.
* use images of sprouting plants (1)

## Prune back the overgrowth

* over time weeds grow in. remove them
* clip dead/dying branches to help prevent disease. 
* this is like refactoring code. 
* it never ends 


## Conclusion

* summarize the key points of the metaphor
1. Remove weeds so that they don't grow back.
2. Preparing the space will allow for more healthy growth.
3.
