## Introduction 

Doing web development is rewarding, but not without it's challenges.  The most challenging part of doing projects is communicating. Even though we have all of the fancy platforms for communicationg it is still incredibly challenging to articulate technical things to non-technical people. I've always used comparissons to help fill in the gaps wherever possible. For the most part this has been successful.

Very often I've encountered the use of `home construction` as a comparisson to help explain things. At my <a href="https://www.specialized.com">last job</a> the CFO used this comparisson multiple times a day. She would ask us if we're "painting the walls" or "messing with the plumbing". The problem with these comparissons is that code is `alive` and a completed building project is not.

What do I mean by "alive"?  I mean, specifically, that even after launch code needs to be refactored for performance improvements,  for bug fixes, and for adding new features.  A completed construction project is completely done upon delivery. Usually at the time of launch a new web project is only just beginning to be built.

A better comparisson is one about gardening. 


## Preparing the site

* for a website to be successful, just like a garden, a tremendous amount of preparation and planning are required.  
* Site evaluation. Which areas get the most sunlight?
* determine what needs to be completely demolished. because destroying old things is fun.
* select the best ~~variety of plants~~ content strategy for your needs. 
* knowledge transfer.  make sure your team members are on the same page at al steps.  community garden comparission.

## Hardscaping

* determine what parts of your garden are structure and can't be moved
* in a website context: this might mean determinig a new, more efficient,  schema for a legacy database table. 
* we're going to plant around and in this structure. we want to make the right choice for the situation.


## Turn the soil

Bad software development habits are a bit like perennial weeds. If you don't dig out as many roots as you can then the weeds will grow back. In the context of a website this means that outdated software development techniqes will persist into your brand new project unless those techniques are removed by "the roots".

Smart gardeners turn their soil over before planting a new crop. This allows new plantings to grow more easily because the soil is loose and full of oxygen.

2. dolor
3. sit
4. amet

## Things start to fill in.

* garden prep is like website prototyping.  explain why.
* just as the garden starts to fill,  in the website prototype becomes to be more vibrant.
* use images of sprouting plants (1)

## Prune back the overgrowth

* over time weeds grow in. remove them
* clip dead/dying branches to help prevent disease. 
* this is like refactoring code. 
* it never ends 


## Conclusion

* summarize the key points of the comparisson
1. Remove weeds so that they don't grow back.
2. Preparing the space will allow for more healthy growth.
3.
