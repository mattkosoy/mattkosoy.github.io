## Introduction

A couple weeks ago my buddy <a href="http://activenative.com">Tony V</a> asked if I could help him get his laptop set up for doing web development. There are a <a href="https://mallinson.ca/osx-web-development/">variety</a> <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/04/stop-installing-your-webdev-environment-locally-with-docker/">of</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/45mkks/best_practice_web_development_environment_for_osx/"> approaches</a> for how you could go about doing this. This post is my suggestion for getting things set up relatively quickly and efficiently.  This post is not the _definitve_ way to get things set up.  You should use the method that works best for you.


<a href="http://tony.activenative.com/">Tony Voorhees</a> is a San Francisco based artist, art director, and designer. He's been a friend and colleauge for just about twenty years now. He has over a decade of experience designing systems for small businesses, design agencies and product companies.  His most recent position was on the design team at <a href="https://www.draftkings.com/">Draftkings</a>.  <a href="/about">I</a> am the author of this website, and (more importantly) am <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/zainabkosoy/">Zainab's</a> dad.

## Tony's workflow status quo. 

Tony mostly does interaction design, and because of that he hadn't spent much time adjusting his workflow.  It was easiest for him to use <a href="https://www.mamp.info/">MAMP</a> to do web development on his laptop. When his work was in a state of completion he would use an FTP app like <a href="https://panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> to transfer files to a server.  While this method can be leveraged successfully, there are other techniques that Tony could use to do this stuff.  

Tony's a designer. He was put off by how the new-fangled tools are meant to work. I don't blame him. Using the terminal can be a bit overwhelming if you aren't used to using it. Installing mamp makes it easy to turn the servers off and on, and configuring things easy too.  The problem was(is), that the job market for designers in SF is very competetive. Employers are looking for designers who also know modern software development techniques, not just photoshop skills.  


## Describing the new new

* <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop">Laptop</a> 
* What's the terminal?  
* bash vs zsh --- find links
* Git for all of the things
* use a manual transmission metaphor as a means to describe what the terminal is doing.

## Customizations to your shell as part of the set up process

* solarized
* oh-my-zsh & pygmalion theme
* enable hidden files b/c its faster -- add alias to the shell
* sourcing the .zshrc config
* add git aliases 
* dotfiles - a post that should be its own thing

## Jekyll w Bootstrap

* databases suck
* what is a static site generator
* installing jekyll
* watching files
* working with markdown
* jekyll themes

## Pushing to github pages
* git workflow
* merging code
* custom domain names

## You're a preprocessor.
* gulp what?

## Summary & conclusion
* review 
* links to things.
